# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added the read-only BLE `snapshot` command using the versioned `t2can-maintenance-snapshot-v1` schema. It combines firmware identity, runtime counters, CAN driver health, receive-side telemetry, and current configuration without enabling CAN transmission or changing state.
- Added `scripts/collect_vehicle_snapshot.py` for bounded Mac-side collection from private ESP32 dashboard endpoints. It writes an atomic mode-0600 JSON artifact, rejects public hosts by default, and redacts local network identity from the optional support report.
- Added `scripts/collect_vehicle_incidents.py`, a one-shot read-only incident sync client that verifies event metadata and content before private archive commit and `/event_ack`.
- Added `scripts/receive_vehicle_incidents.py`, a localhost-only receiver for S26 uploads with bearer-token authentication, bounded bodies, idempotent duplicate handling, conflict detection, and durable read-back verification.
- Added the read-only UDP `t2can-discovery-v1` response on port `36991` so a local S26 worker can discover EVCANTool without a fixed DHCP address. The listener is non-blocking, packet-bounded, and advertises no control or credential data.
- Added the initial `android-gateway` S26 application slice: UDP discovery, authenticated ESP32 event download, `.part`/size/SHA-256 verification, durable SQLite queue leases, HTTPS Mac upload response validation, and ACK only after the Mac commit result is persisted. Physical S26 validation and Tailscale Serve deployment remain separate gates.

### Safety

- The collection path is pull-only and read-only. It does not implement phone-to-Mac Internet upload, OTA, or automatic CAN rule generation; observed frames remain evidence for manual review.

## [4.0.0-beta.2] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- BLE `send` command: injects a burst of up to 16 CAN frames once, so a phone app button can put a stored frame on the bus. Frames are given as `{"id":"0x3E1","data":"48A600"}` (id as hex string or number, payload as hex, optional `bus`), and every frame is validated before any is sent so a malformed burst cannot be half-injected. Standard 11-bit ids only, and no per-frame delay — the command runs on the BLE host task.
- BLE `inject` command (`{"cmd":"inject","args":{"on":true}}`) to flip the master injection switch, mirroring the dashboard toggle and persisted to NVS. Without it `gated / injection disabled` was a dead end for a phone app: the dashboard that offers the toggle is unreachable while the device is in BLE mode.
- `send` is subject to exactly the same gates as automatic injection (`dashInjectionActive()`), and a rejection names the closed gate: `{"ok":false,"error":"gated","reason":"injection disabled"|"warming up"|"ap gate"|"summon-only gate"}`. A phone must not be able to write to the bus in a state where the firmware would refuse to itself.
- BLE `config` command: reads the dashboard's configuration block, or applies only the keys present in `args` and echoes the stored state back, so a client can send one field per change instead of rewriting everything. Covers `hw`, `sp`/`spa`, `can`, `apg`, `smo`, `nag`, `plgr` and the HW3 offset slew settings.
- BLE `stats` command: live counters (`canFrames`, `canAgeMs`, `txOk`, `txFail`, `freeHeap`, `uptimeS`) plus the vehicle state the injection gates key off (`parked`, `apActive`, `summoning`, `gateAllowed`, `gateReason`). Separate from `status` so the frequently polled reply stays small.

### Changed

- `handleConfig` is split into `ctrlApplyConfig` over a `ConfigArgs` lookup, and `handleConfigGet` into `ctrlBuildConfigJson`. `POST /config` and the BLE `config` command now run the same validator. The configuration rules are safety-relevant — Nag Mode C is refused on HW4 after reported control faults, and the speed profile range depends on the hardware — so a second copy for BLE would have been a copy free to drift. No behaviour change to the HTTP route: the transformation was mechanical.

### Fixed

- The dashboard now has controls for the BLE app at all. `/ble_mode` and `/ble_pin` have existed since 4.0.0-beta.1, but nothing in the UI ever called them, so neither switching into BLE mode nor reading the pairing passkey was possible from the dashboard — the passkey was only obtainable from the serial log. The new card shows the current interface mode and the passkey, switches to BLE, and can regenerate the passkey.
- BLE mode is no longer given up on every power cycle. The 10-minute fallback to WiFi now only runs while a switch into BLE mode is unproven: the first client connection confirms the mode for good (NVS `ble_prob`), and later reboots keep it. Previously the timer restarted on every boot, so a device that lives in BLE mode fell back to WiFi whenever nobody connected within ten minutes of powering on — for something plugged into a car, most of the time. The lockout the timer guards against is still covered, since it is the switch itself that arms it.

### Verified

- On device: the dashboard's BLE card reads the mode and passkey and switches into BLE mode, and the app connects afterwards.

## [4.0.0-beta.1] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Bluetooth LE (NimBLE) app interface (`-DBLE_APP`): a custom GATT service with a paginated JSON command protocol (`status`, `ping`) so a phone app can talk to the device. Large replies are fetched in bounded pages to stay within the 512-byte GATT attribute limit.
- BLE link security: LE Secure Connections with a 6-digit passkey (MITM) and bonding. The Command and Response characteristics require encryption and authentication, so an unpaired peer can connect but cannot read or write. The passkey is generated on the device and available via `GET /ble_pin`.
- WiFi ↔ BLE interface mode switch. WiFi and BLE cannot run together reliably on ESP32 classic (shared radio), so the device boots into exactly one mode. Switch to BLE with `POST /ble_mode?on=1` or back with a BLE `wifi_mode` command; a 10-minute safety timeout returns to WiFi if no app connects.
- Dev/test mode: a runtime-toggleable simulated CAN traffic generator so the device is usable on the bench with no transceiver/bus attached. Toggle with `POST /dev_mode?on=1`; a serial heartbeat reports simulated activity. `DASH_DEV_MODE_ON_BOOT` starts a bench unit straight in dev mode.
- CAN driver TX loopback (`CanDriver::setSimLoopback`) used by dev mode so a board without a transceiver does not accumulate TX errors while injection/plugins run.
- Native unit test for the dev-mode frame generator.

## [3.1.1] - 2026-08-03

Stable release bundling all changes from `3.0.2-beta.1` through
`3.0.2-beta.15`.

This release is functionally identical to `3.1.0`. Version `3.1.1` was
published to correct the stable release metadata.

### Added

- Added an optional, fail-closed Summon-only injection policy for ESP-IDF
  dashboard builds. Injection is permitted only while definitively parked at
  `0 km/h` or during a confirmed active Summon session.
- Added built-in Nag Suppression modes Off, A, B, and C, including dashboard
  controls, NVS persistence, settings backup/restore, diagnostics, and
  regression coverage.
- Added ESP32-C6 support with its own PlatformIO environment, CI build, OTA
  partition layout, and release artifact.
- Added LILYGO T-2CAN support. The final implementation uses the board's CAN A
  MCP2515 interface at 16 MHz, including hardware reset handling and a dedicated
  OTA artifact.
- Added read-only SavvyCAN USB serial logging using GVRET framing, with explicit
  dashboard arming and bounded non-blocking sessions.
- Added startup and runtime diagnostics for reset reason, boot count, heap,
  task stacks, CAN traffic, TWAI state, queue pressure, errors, recovery,
  WiFi, web requests, and injection gates.
- Added an on-demand bounded Support report that omits credentials and secrets.
- Added beginner-oriented onboarding, CAN terminology, board selection,
  flashing, dashboard, plugin, safety, troubleshooting, Nag Suppression, and
  ESP32 optimization documentation.
- Added shared PlatformIO-based VS Code IntelliSense configuration.

### Changed

- Dashboard startup is now independent of CAN availability. CAN initialization
  waits ten seconds and injection waits at least fifteen seconds after CAN
  initialization plus more than 1,000 valid received frames.
- Reduced idle web-maintenance and disabled-GVRET wakeups from 100 Hz to 4 Hz.
- Removed periodic plugin polling and reduced unnecessary dashboard requests.
- Split dashboard configuration and statistics responses, added overlap guards,
  retries, null-safe rendering, and disabled controls until configuration loads.
- Simplified dashboard diagnostics to runtime status, Support, and Last Write
  Check. Obsolete sniffer, recorder, controller/mux, live-log, and rule-test
  diagnostic paths were removed.
- Dashboard assets are now generated deterministically from the authoritative
  source header.
- Shared ESP-IDF PlatformIO defaults replace repeated board configuration.
- GitHub Pages now publishes the checked-in onboarding page directly.
- Release automation now selects the correct board-specific OTA artifact for
  every supported ESP-IDF environment.
- Repository ignore rules and editor configuration were simplified and made
  portable.

### Fixed

- AP Injection Gate now treats INVALID/SNA gear as unknown instead of Park.
- Plugin injection through the AP path now requires AP to remain stable for one
  second.
- Legacy FSD activation injection waits until Autopilot has remained active for
  two seconds.
- AP state 6 remains accepted as active, while available, aborting, faulted,
  missing, stale, or unknown states remain blocked.
- HW4 AP state is now decoded from the low nibble of byte 0 in Party CAN
  `0x39B`.
- Nag Mode C now uses the correct Legacy/HW3 DAS status, hands-on state, steering
  angle, freshness, AP-state, and steering-angle checks.
- HW4 may select Nag Modes A and B for controlled Party CAN testing. Mode C
  remains blocked on HW4.
- Transitioning to a blocked injection state now clears cached periodic frames
  and pending TWAI or MCP2515 transmissions.
- TWAI and MCP2515 drivers now reject invalid, extended, and RTR frames, preserve
  all required filter IDs, report failures, and recover more reliably from
  initialization errors and bus faults.
- Missing CAN traffic no longer restarts the dashboard firmware.
- TWAI status and bus-off recovery reporting now reflect the actual driver state.
- MCP2515 register transfers, DLC handling, receive-buffer cleanup, error
  propagation, and timer rollover handling were hardened.
- Plugin JSON now enforces schema types, numeric ranges, bus names, CAN IDs,
  DLCs, operations, periodic-send scope, and counter masks.
- Plugin execution, persistence, diagnostics, priority changes, periodic sends,
  and UDS state are synchronized across CAN, HTTP, and maintenance tasks.
- Plugin counters advance only after successful transmissions.
- Plugin updates now use a recoverable temporary/backup swap and repair
  interrupted saves during boot.
- NVS errors now propagate correctly, writes are committed once per preference
  session, and failed multi-key changes restore the previous runtime state.
- Settings backup no longer exposes WiFi credentials without authentication and
  now preserves live AP, multi-network, CAN, plugin, update, and hardware
  settings.
- Static-IP values, WiFi credentials, GPIOs, indexes, and configuration values
  are validated instead of being truncated or silently coerced.
- GitHub OTA now verifies HTTPS, certificate time, board-specific artifacts,
  redirects, streamed/chunked responses, completed firmware images, and
  concurrent update attempts.
- Authenticated multipart firmware uploads no longer require buffering the
  complete image in RAM.
- Dashboard, WiFi, logging, recorder, LED, OTA, plugin-test, and preference
  state no longer race across FreeRTOS tasks.
- ESP-IDF images now declare the correct board-specific flash size and OTA
  layout.
- Fixed the Arduino/SAMD `abs` macro conflict affecting legacy builds.

### Safety

- Summon-only injection and Nag Suppression remain disabled by default.
- All injection continues to pass the centralized startup, vehicle-state,
  freshness, and transmit gates.
- Built-in Nag Suppression remains limited to `-1.80 Nm` through `+1.80 Nm`
  and preserves the original `0x370` DLC, counter, and checksum handling.
- Unknown, stale, invalid, contradictory, or unsupported vehicle state fails
  closed.
- Mode C remains disabled on HW4.
- No new vehicle or software-version compatibility claim is made.

## [3.0.2-beta.15] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- The LILYGO T-2CAN build now uses the board's CAN A MCP2515 interface at 16 MHz, including its hardware reset, so Party CAN no longer runs through the CAN B/TWAI path implicated by issue #81 diagnostics.
- HW4 can select built-in Nag Modes A/B again; Mode C remains blocked.

### Safety

- Nag suppression still defaults to Off, retains the `±1.80 Nm` hard bound and global injection gates, and requires Party CAN. HW4 Mode C continues to fail closed after reported extended-use control faults.

## [3.0.2-beta.14] - 2026-07-25

### Changed

- Shared ESP-IDF PlatformIO defaults now replace repeated board configuration.
- GitHub Pages now publishes the checked-in onboarding page without a generator or string-presence test.
- The ignore list now contains only repository-relevant generated and local files.

### Safety

- Arduino targets, Arduino compatibility code, CAN handling, and transmit gates are unchanged.

## [3.0.2-beta.13] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- Mode C now keeps fresh DAS and steering context while the AP injection gate is closed, without permitting transmission before every global gate allows it.
- Status and Support diagnostics now report AP-gate permission, reason, AP activity, stability age, Park, and Summon state so a blocked gate can be identified from one capture.

### Safety

- All built-in nag modes now fail closed on HW4 after vehicle testing reported immediate control faults with Modes A/B and red take-over plus traction-control and auto-hold faults after extended Mode C use. Existing stored HW4 nag selections reset to Off.
- Legacy/HW3 algorithms, CAN IDs, frame layouts, checksums, counters, torque limits, and global transmit gates are unchanged.

## [3.0.2-beta.12] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- Dashboard builds now block Nag Modes A/B on HW4 after those fixed/burst torque algorithms caused take-over and control-fault warnings on current vehicle software. Existing stored A/B selections fail closed to Off at runtime when HW4 loads; Legacy/HW3 behavior is unchanged.
- Built-in Nag Mode C now selects DAS status `0x399` for Legacy/HW3 and `0x39B` for HW4, decodes AP state from byte 0 bits 0–3 and hands-on state from byte 5 bits 2–5, and decodes `0x129` steering angle from bytes 2–3 with its `-819.2°` offset.
- Mode C now accepts eligible real `0x370` frames with `handsOnLevel=1`, matching the reviewed reference state-machine behavior, while still rejecting its own echoes.

### Safety

- Invalid steering-angle validity, missing context, context older than one second, AP states outside 3–6, and steering angles beyond `±5°` block Mode C transmission. Hardware-mode changes reset all cached Mode C context.
- Legacy/HW3 Modes A/B, `0x370` payload construction, counter/checksum handling, burst timing, torque bounds, and global injection gates are unchanged.

## [3.0.2-beta.11] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- HW4 AP status now decodes `DAS_autopilotState` from the low nibble of byte 0 in Party CAN `0x39B`, so the AP injection gate recognizes active states on current vehicle software instead of reading unrelated byte-1 data.

### Safety

- The change only corrects passive AP-state decoding for the existing gate. CAN IDs, transmit payloads, checksums, counters, timing, startup gates, and torque limits are unchanged; unknown, unavailable, aborting, and fault states remain blocked.

## [3.0.2-beta.10] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- VS Code now uses PlatformIO as the shared IntelliSense configuration provider on normal hosts and inside the dev container, so selecting a PlatformIO environment supplies its matching compiler, defines, and include paths.
- Removed the committed machine-specific `compile_commands.json`; PlatformIO-generated editor files and compilation databases now remain local instead of pinning another developer to one board and one filesystem layout.

### Safety

- This release changes editor configuration and documentation only. CAN filters, frame handling, transmit gates, timing, and firmware runtime behavior are unchanged.

## [3.0.2-beta.9] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- Added the LILYGO T-2CAN as the `lilygo_t2can` ESP-IDF dashboard environment, using its native CAN1 TWAI interface on TX GPIO7 and RX GPIO6 with a 16 MB OTA partition layout.
- Added LILYGO T-2CAN test and release builds, including the `firmware-lilygo-t2can.bin` OTA artifact.

### Safety

- The board target uses only the native CAN1 TWAI interface. It does not import the reference fork's custom secondary MCP2515 behavior or change CAN filters, transmit gates, frame handling, or timing.

## [3.0.2-beta.8] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Added dashboard buttons for built-in nag suppression Off, Mode A, Mode B, and Mode C. This path is implemented directly in firmware and does not use plugins.
- Mode A keeps the fixed `+1.80 Nm` counter-echo behavior. Mode B cycles `+1.80`, `+1.50`, `-1.50`, and `-1.80 Nm` during a one-second burst followed by a 1.5-second pause. Mode C follows the reviewed DAS hands-on state machine using `0x399` and `0x129` context.
- Added NVS persistence, settings backup/restore, Support-report output, merged CAN filters, and native/regression coverage for the selected nag mode.

### Safety

- Nag suppression defaults to Off in dashboard builds, remains bounded to `-1.80 Nm` through `+1.80 Nm`, preserves exact `0x370` DLC/counter/checksum handling, and still passes the existing global startup and Summon-only transmit gates.
- Mode C fails closed when AP state or steering context is missing, older than one second, outside supported AP states, or beyond `±5 degrees` steering angle.

## [3.0.2-beta.7] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Added beta **Summon-only injection** for ESP-IDF dashboard builds. Default remains disabled. When enabled, every ESP-IDF CAN transmit passes one centralized, fail-closed policy that requires fresh `DI_systemStatus` (`0x118`) gear/ACA, `DI_speed` (`0x257`) vehicle speed, `UI_driverAssistControl` (`0x3F8`) Summon request, and DAS AP state (`0x399` on Legacy/HW3 or `0x39B` on HW4).
- Added dashboard, NVS, settings-backup, Support-report, and regression-test coverage for parked/stationary, active Summon, manual driving, AP, unexpected movement, state transitions, missing/stale/invalid signals, contradictory gear, disabled-mode compatibility, and setting restoration.

### Safety

- Summon-only mode allows injection only in definitive Park at exactly `0 km/h`, or while `DI_autonomyControlActive=1` agrees with a confirmed active `UI_selfParkRequest` session. AP active, R/N/D without confirmed Summon, movement without confirmed Summon, SNA/invalid data, signal age over 500 ms, and contradictory fresh `0x118`/`0x186` gear observations block transmission.
- A transition to a blocked policy state clears cached periodic plugin frames and pending ESP-IDF TWAI or MCP2515 hardware transmissions. The driver-level transmit gate rechecks policy immediately before every send, covering handler writes, plugin rewrites/replays, periodic emissions, and plugin GTW UDS traffic.
- This feature remains beta because exact Tesla signal behavior can differ by vehicle and software version. No new vehicle/software compatibility claim is made.

## [3.0.2-beta.6] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Reworked the documentation for beginners: project overview, board selection, first boot, dashboard use, plugin safety, CAN evidence, troubleshooting, and runtime measurements now follow one guided path.
- Added clear explanations of CAN IDs, frames, DLC, muxes, counters, checksums, TWAI, MCP2515, GVRET, and Support diagnostics.
- Restored Support as collapsed final dashboard section backed by one on-demand, bounded plain-text report. It includes firmware/build/chip/flash/reset, heap and task stack watermarks, WiFi identity/signal, CAN/TWAI health and queue pressure, filters/gates/safety limits, Last Write Check, NVS recovery, GVRET, and web metrics without credentials or secrets.
- Added lightweight request/response, support size, task wake, heap low-water, logging throttle, and TWAI maximum queue-depth measurements plus ESP32 optimization guidance.

### Changed

- Replaced frequently polled `/status` `String` construction with fixed-buffer formatting, removed periodic plugin polling, reduced idle WiFi/status requests, and polls GVRET only while active.
- Reduced idle web-maintenance and disabled-GVRET task wakeups from 100 Hz to 4 Hz without changing CAN timing, task priorities, injection behavior, or safety gates.


## [3.0.2-beta.5] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- ESP-IDF startup/runtime diagnostics: reset reason, RTC boot count, brownout warning, IDF version, five-second loop/CAN/web heartbeats, CAN age, TX results, free heap, uptime, and detailed TWAI state/error/recovery status.
- Read-only SavvyCAN USB serial logging through reference GVRET framing, with explicit dashboard arming, clean binary-log ownership, one 500 kbit/s bus, validated standard frames, idle/disconnect handling, and bounded nonblocking sessions.
- Nag-suppression guide covering Party CAN placement, startup gates, torque limits, target IDs, SavvyCAN observation, and Tesla electrical-reference lookup.

### Changed

- Dashboard now starts before TWAI, TWAI waits 10 seconds before initialization, and injection waits 15 seconds from actual CAN initialization plus more than 1,000 valid received frames.
- Dashboard diagnostics are reduced to runtime status and Last Write Check. Sniffer, recorder, controller/mux views, live log, rule-test/editor diagnostics, obsolete endpoints, and backing state were removed while configuration, plugins, connectivity, safety, backup, and updates remain.
- Dashboard configuration and statistics now use separate responses, with retry/error handling, request overlap guards, null-safe rendering, and disabled controls until configuration loads.
- Dashboard source header is authoritative; generated raw/gzip header now comes from deterministic standard-library generation during dashboard builds.

### Fixed

- Missing CAN traffic no longer causes restart; firmware/dashboard stay alive and emit throttled warnings. TWAI bus-off now uses ESP-IDF recovery API, and TX failure logs are throttled while preserving two-millisecond transmit wait.
- Dashboard TWAI states and colors now map stopped/running/bus-off/recovering correctly.
- Nag echo handling validates DLC, detects self frames using full 12-bit torque, enforces raw and `-1.80 Nm` to `+1.80 Nm` hard bounds, resets injection sequence state on live mode changes, and counts only successful transmissions.
- NVS recovery erases storage only for no-free-pages or new-version initialization errors.
- ESP-IDF image headers now follow each board's declared 4 MB or 8 MB flash size; generic `esp32_twai` also uses project 4 MB OTA partition layout, matching current firmware size.

## [3.0.2-beta.4] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- ESP32-C6 support via the new `esp32c6_twai` PlatformIO environment (ESP-IDF, `DRIVER_TWAI` on GPIO5/GPIO4, `partitions_4mb_ota_1536k.csv`). Added to the Tests CI matrix and the Release workflow so automation builds and OTA release assets include the C6 board.
- Board-specific OTA artifact selection for every supported ESP-IDF environment.
- Verified HTTPS downloads using the ESP-IDF certificate bundle and SNTP-backed certificate-time validation.

### Fixed

- AP Injection Gate now keeps standard DAS `ACTIVE` state 6 engaged while rejecting `AVAILABLE` state 2 and abort/fault states 8/9.
- HW4 AP state now comes from CAN `0x39B` byte 1 instead of misreading the HW4 `0x399` ISA frame, with the confirmed 2026.20 Highland byte-0 fallback after a three-frame latch.
- Legacy activation stability timing now works when AP becomes active at the `millis()` zero epoch.
- ESP-IDF HTTP response streaming, query-route matching, URL decoding, response status codes, bounded request handling, and authenticated multipart firmware uploads now work correctly without buffering firmware in RAM.
- GitHub OTA now selects only the current board artifact, rejects artifact substitutions and HTTPS downgrades, supports chunked transfers, reports install failures accurately, validates the completed image, and serializes concurrent update attempts.
- Settings backup no longer exposes WiFi credentials without authentication, now exports live AP and multi-network state, and preserves dashboard, CAN, plugin, update, and HW3 settings during restore.
- Static-IP configuration is validated and applied through ESP-NETIF, with DHCP fallback on runtime failure; malformed SSIDs, indexes, pins, and configuration values now fail closed instead of truncating or coercing.
- TWAI and external MCP2515 drivers now reject invalid, extended, and RTR frames, preserve all handler/plugin acceptance IDs across mode changes, recover after initialization and bus faults, and synchronize diagnostics, filtering, receive, transmit, and recovery operations.
- ESP-IDF now uses 1 kHz FreeRTOS ticks and a true scheduler yield, preserving millisecond CAN timeouts and preventing the main loop from sleeping 10 ms on every pass.
- The native MCP2515 SPI implementation now propagates bus/device/transaction errors, bounds register transfers and DLC values, clears invalid receive buffers, and handles timer rollover safely.
- Plugin JSON parsing now enforces schema types, numeric ranges, bus tokens, CAN IDs, frame DLC, operation limits, periodic-emission scope, and counter masks instead of wrapping or silently ignoring malformed rules.
- Plugin execution, diagnostics, tests, persistence, priority changes, and periodic/UDS state are synchronized across the CAN, HTTP, and maintenance tasks; counters advance only after successful sends.
- Plugin updates now use a reset-recoverable temp/backup swap compatible with SPIFFS rename semantics, and interrupted saves are repaired on boot.
- Dashboard logs, recorder state, WiFi state, preferences, handler publication, LED output, OTA state, and plugin-test state no longer race across FreeRTOS tasks or report failed writes as successful.
- NVS writes are committed once per preference session, write and erase errors propagate to callers, invalid stored values fall back safely, and multi-key changes restore runtime state when persistence fails.

## [3.0.2-beta.3] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- Legacy FSD activation injection on CAN `0x3EE` mux 0 now waits until Autopilot has remained active for 2 seconds when the AP Injection Gate is enabled, preventing false parked gate states and activation timing races from injecting during initial engagement.
## [3.0.2-beta.2] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- Dashboard AP Injection Gate now waits for AP to remain stable for one second before allowing plugin injection through the AP path, reducing activation-edge injection during FSD/AP engagement transients while keeping Park and Summon injection behavior unchanged.

## [3.0.2-beta.1] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- AP Injection Gate now treats live INVALID/SNA gear values as unknown instead of Park, preventing Start After AP plugin injection while AP is inactive unless the car is definitively in Park or Summoning.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- Republished the stable 3.0 release through the normal main-branch release workflow so firmware assets can be attached before the release is published immutable.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-05-21

Stable release bundling the `3.0.0-beta.1` through `3.0.0-beta.9` changes.

### Added

- ESP-IDF native build path for supported targets, including ESP-IDF runtime shims, IDF RGB LED support, dashboard gzip serving, and multi-SSID WiFi.
- Status LED brightness control, AP Gate Diagnostics, CAN driver diagnostics, HW4 Offset Slew support, and plugin rule diagnostics in the dashboard and support reports.
- Plugin rule byte-mask matching and the example `0x370` duplicate-counter plugin.
- Manual firmware upload control to clear saved OTA credentials from browser local storage.

### Changed

- ESP-IDF builds are pinned through PlatformIO `platformio/espressif32` 7.0.0, with legacy Arduino boards moved under `legacy-arduino`.
- Release and CI workflows cover supported ESP-IDF and legacy Arduino targets.
- Dashboard assets are minified and served as gzip-compressed content to reduce flash usage.

### Fixed

- Dashboard CAN recorder CSV rows now use real comma separators.
- ESP-IDF dashboard serving avoids large `String` copies and httpd stack overflows.
- WiFi scan/save flows are more reliable in AP+STA mode.
- Release workflows handle legacy Arduino board builds from `legacy-arduino`.
- Plugin `or_byte` and `and_byte` operations apply their configured values correctly.
- Dashboard Support button placement is generated from the footer source HTML.

## [3.0.0-beta.9] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- Plugin rule diagnostics now report match, change, and transmit counters plus last original/modified frames in `/plugins` and support reports.

### Fixed

- Dashboard CAN recorder CSV rows now use real comma separators.

## [3.0.0-beta.8] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Added AP Gate Diagnostics to /status and the Support report to debug false Active injection states.

## [3.0.0-beta.7] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Add HW4 support for the web-native Offset Slew limiter while preserving existing HW3-compatible settings keys.

## [3.0.0-beta.6] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- CAN driver diagnostics are now exposed through the driver interface and logged at startup.
- TWAI builds now report TX/RX pins, driver state, queue counters, bus errors, recovery count, rejected frame count, and last ESP-IDF CAN errors.

### Fixed

- Added a regression test proving `or_byte` and `and_byte` plugin operations apply their configured values correctly.
- Moved the dashboard Support button from the Configuration card into the footer source HTML.

## [3.0.0-beta.5] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- RGB status LED now reflects runtime state at a glance: solid green = injecting + at least one client connected, blinking green = injecting with no client connected, solid red = injection stopped + connected, blinking red = injection stopped + no client. Solid blue indicates an in-progress OTA firmware update. "Connected" is true when any station is associated with the AP or when the STA uplink is up.

## [3.0.0-beta.4] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- Manual firmware upload now has a dashboard button to clear saved OTA username/password credentials from browser local storage.

## [3.0.0-beta.3] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- Plugin rules can now include an additional byte-mask match (`match_byte`, `match_mask`, `match_val`) so plugins can target specific bit states without adding dedicated firmware toggles.
- Added an example `0x370` duplicate-counter plugin that matches byte 4 bits 7:6 clear, forces byte 3 to `0xB6`, sets byte 4 bit 6, increments byte 6 low-nibble counter, and recomputes byte 7 checksum.

### Fixed

- ESP-IDF WiFi Internet saves now defer reconnect until after the HTTP response, preventing the dashboard request from being dropped while AP+STA mode changes channels.
- Switching saved WiFi networks now disconnects any existing STA association before connecting to the new SSID, avoiding repeated `sta is connected` / deauth log spam.
- WiFi scan now prepares AP+STA mode before scanning, so scans work when the device is otherwise in AP-only mode.
- ESP-IDF WiFi/httpd/netif component logs are reduced to warning/error levels to keep dashboard serial logs readable.

## [3.0.0-beta.2] - 2026-05-04

### Changed

- Pin ESP-IDF builds to ESP-IDF v6.0.1 through PlatformIO `platformio/espressif32` 7.0.0 and keep legacy Arduino boards in `legacy-arduino`.
- Build all supported ESP-IDF and legacy Arduino targets in GitHub Actions, including release artifacts for AtomS3 Mini CAN Base and Waveshare ESP32-S3 RS485/CAN.

### Fixed

- Release and test workflows now run legacy Arduino board builds from `legacy-arduino`, so RP2040 and Feather M4 CI no longer look for removed root Arduino environments.
- CI installs the Python package needed by ESP-IDF 6.0.1 tooling and skips clang-format on the generated dashboard payload header.

## [3.0.0-beta.1] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- ESP-IDF 5.5 native build path replacing the Arduino framework on supported targets (M5Stack AtomS3 Lite verified). Adds `src/espidf_runtime.cpp` plus `include/platform/espidf_runtime.h` providing Arduino-compatible shims (`String`, `WiFi`, `WebServer`, `Preferences`, `Update`, `HTTPClient`, `SPIFFS`, etc.) on top of ESP-IDF APIs.
- ESP-IDF `led_strip` (RMT) implementation of the on-board RGB status LED so the AtomS3 Lite indicator works under IDF (green = injecting, red = idle).
- "Status LED Brightness" subsection in the Configuration card with a slider and number input (0–255), persisted in NVS (`led_b`) and applied live via `/led_brightness`.
- Multi-SSID WiFi support — up to 4 saved networks. The device tries each in turn until one connects (e.g. home + phone hotspot). New endpoints `/wifi_networks`, `/wifi_delete`; `/wifi_config` accepts an `idx` argument to update a specific slot. Legacy single-SSID NVS keys auto-migrate to slot 0 on first boot.
- `scripts/minify_dashboard.py` — minifies the dashboard HTML/CSS/JS (csscompressor + terser + htmlmin) and emits a gzipped `DASH_HTML_GZ[]` payload served with `Content-Encoding: gzip`. Dashboard source-of-truth moved to `include/web/mcp2515_dashboard_ui.src.h`.

### Changed

- Flash usage on `m5stack-atoms3-mini-can-base` reduced from 79.0 % (1,243,217 B) to 64.8 % (1,019,835 B) — about 223 KB saved with no feature loss. Drivers:
  - `CONFIG_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION_SIZE=y` (was `OPTIMIZATION_DEBUG`),
  - `CONFIG_NEWLIB_NANO_FORMAT=y` plus integer formatting for the FPS field,
  - `CONFIG_ESP_ERR_TO_NAME_LOOKUP=n`,
  - `CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_LOG_LEVEL_ERROR=y`,
  - gzipped dashboard HTML (≈120 KB raw rodata → ≈30 KB compressed).
- `WebServer::send_P` no longer copies the body into a `String` (which OOM'd on the 130 KB dashboard HTML and aborted the httpd task). It now streams large responses in 4 KB chunks via `httpd_resp_send_chunk` directly from the source pointer (`sendRaw`).
- `WebServer::begin()` bumps the IDF httpd task stack to 16 KB and moves the per-request URL-query buffer to the heap, fixing a stack overflow on the first dashboard hit.

### Fixed

- `httpd` task stack overflow on the first client connection on ESP-IDF builds.
- `bad_alloc` / `terminate` reboot when serving the root dashboard page over the soft-AP on ESP-IDF builds.

## [2.6.0-beta.1] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Added MCP2515 recovery regression coverage for the RP2040 CAN driver.
- Added `platformio_profile.example.h` as the committed build-config template.

### Changed

- `platformio_profile.h` is now treated as a local-only build config and ignored by git. Copy `platformio_profile.example.h` to `platformio_profile.h` before building, then keep board choices, credentials, and keys in the local file.
- Build documentation and helper-script errors now describe `platformio_profile.h` as the local build config and point fresh checkouts to the example file.

### Fixed

- RP2040 MCP2515 builds now recover the CAN controller after repeated TX failures or MCP2515 bus-off (`EFLG_TXBO`) instead of staying silent until power-cycled.
- CI test and release builds now create their local `platformio_profile.h` from `platformio_profile.example.h` before applying per-board build profiles.

## [2.5.2] - 2026-04-29

Stable release bundling the AP Injection Gate Smart Summon fixes from `2.5.2-beta.1` through `2.5.2-beta.6`.

### Fixed

- AP Injection Gate no longer drops during Smart Summon launches that report `DI_autonomyControlActive` while still in Park before an immediate turn. Definite Park frames now clear the summon latch only when ACA is inactive, so the earlier non-zero `UI_selfParkRequest` survives the shift out of Park even when no fresh request frame appears after the shift.

## [2.5.2-beta.6] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- AP Injection Gate no longer drops during Smart Summon launches that report `DI_autonomyControlActive` while still in Park before an immediate turn. Definite Park frames now clear the summon latch only when ACA is inactive, so the earlier non-zero `UI_selfParkRequest` survives the shift out of Park even when no fresh request frame appears after the shift.

## [2.5.2-beta.5] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- AP Injection Gate no longer stays open for 3-5 s after Autopilot is disengaged, and no longer treats plain TACC as an open-gate condition. `DI_autonomyControlActive` (ACA) on CAN 280 is set during AP, TACC, *and* Smart Summon, so it cannot drive Summoning by itself. Summoning now requires both `ACA=1` *and* a `UI_selfParkRequest` non-zero command observed in the current autonomy episode. ACA falling edge resets the spr-seen flag, so a subsequent TACC engagement does not re-latch the gate. The 5 s ACA-only timeout is removed: AP disengage drops ACA immediately and the gate closes immediately, restoring instant AP / TACC re-engagement.

## [2.5.2-beta.4] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- AP Injection Gate now opens on a freshly-booted module when the car is asleep / locked with Sentry. While the DI is asleep, CAN ID 280 (`DI_systemStatus`) is not broadcast at all (only DAS / autopilot ECU IDs 921/1016/1021/2047 keep transmitting), so the previous boot-time `Parked=false` default left the gate stuck at `Waiting AP` until the driver pressed the brake to wake the DI. `Parked` now defaults to `true` at boot; the first `DI_systemStatus` frame with a driving gear (R/N/D) flips it to false. If the DI never reports, the car is asleep / parked and the gate remains open by design.

## [2.5.2-beta.3] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- AP Injection Gate now stays open for the full duration of a Smart Summon / Smart Park session. Detection now uses `DI_autonomyControlActive` (CAN ID 280, bit 50 / byte 6 bit 2) as the primary "summon active" signal in addition to `UI_selfParkRequest` on CAN 1016. The DI bit is held high for the entire time the car is being driven by an autonomy stack, so the 5 s spr-only timeout no longer expires mid-summon when the UI command pulse drops to 0 while the car keeps driving itself.

## [2.5.2-beta.2] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- AP Injection Gate no longer drops while Summon shifts the vehicle to Reverse. `clearSummonOnPark()` now fires only on a definitive `DI_gear == 1 (P)` value, not on the permissive `isVehicleParked` set that also includes `0=INVALID` and `7=SNA`. SNA can blip during gear transitions (e.g. P->R under Summon control), and the previous logic would clear `Summoning` on that blip and close the gate mid-summon. Shift to Drive was unaffected because `selfParkRequest` stayed non-zero long enough to re-latch `Summoning`; Reverse was reaching gear faster than the latch could recover.

## [2.5.2-beta.1] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- AP Injection Gate now opens while the car is asleep / locked with Sentry. `isVehicleParked` now treats `DI_gear` values `0=INVALID` and `7=SNA` as parked in addition to `1=P`. When the DI is asleep it reports SNA on CAN ID 280, which previously left `Parked=false` and kept the gate stuck at `Waiting AP` until the driver pressed the brake to wake the DI. Driving states (R=2, N=3, D=4) are still not parked, so the gate behavior on a moving car is unchanged.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-04-28

Stable release bundling all changes from 2.4.2 onwards (`2.5.0-beta.5` through `2.5.0-beta.12`). Notably, the `Start after AP` dashboard toggle now gates plugin injection on AP, Park, *and* Summon / Smart Park, which makes the firmware compatible with vehicles running Tesla software release **2026.14.3** and newer — these versions reject the always-on injection used by earlier dashboards, so the toggle must be enabled to keep injection working on those vehicles.

### Added

- Dashboard speed profiles now include an `Auto` mode. Auto follows the vehicle follow-distance selection, while a manual dashboard profile stays locked and is injected instead of being overwritten by the car.

### Fixed

- Legacy speed profile selection is now written back into outgoing CAN ID `1006` mux `0` frames so the selected profile actually takes effect on vehicle behavior instead of only changing the observed internal state. (rolled up from 2.4.2-beta.1)
- AP Injection Gate now detects active AP from recorded HW3 `1021` mux `0` frames by reading the observed AD bit, so plugin injection no longer stays stuck at `Waiting AP` after Autopilot is engaged.
- AP Injection Gate now waits for DAS `AutopilotStatus` active states instead of the 1021 UI/config bit, preventing plugin injection from switching to Active when AP is not engaged.
- OTA update finalize now passes `true` to `Update.end()` to force completion regardless of residual byte count, fixing the `Update finalize failed` error that could occur after a successful download via GitHub S3 redirects.
- OTA error paths now log `Update.errorString()` at every failure point (begin, write, finalize) so the root cause is visible in the dashboard log instead of a generic message.
- AP Injection Gate now also opens while the vehicle is in Park, so Summon unlock injection can run while parked and stops again after shifting to Drive.
- Dashboard manual profile selection now persists in firmware state and is applied to Legacy, HW3, and HW4 injection paths.
- AP Injection Gate park detection now also reads `DI_systemStatus` (CAN ID 280) `DI_gear`, so the gate reopens when the vehicle is shifted to Park on Chassis-bus connections that do not carry `DIF_torque`/`DIR_torque` (CAN ID 390). MCP2515 hardware filter slots updated for Legacy, HW3, and HW4 modes to admit ID 280.
- AP Injection Gate now also stays open while Summon / Smart Park is active. HW3 and HW4 handlers parse `UI_driverAssistControl` (CAN ID 1016) `UI_selfParkRequest` (byte 3 bits 4-7); when the request is non-zero (4=PRIME, 5=PAUSE, 7/8=AUTO_SUMMON_FWD/REV, 11=SMART_SUMMON), `Summoning` is asserted and held for 5 s after the last activity, so injection keeps running once the vehicle shifts out of Park into Drive/Reverse under Summon control.
- AP Injection Gate `Summoning` flag is force-cleared whenever the vehicle returns to Park, so a manual P->D shift after a completed summon correctly waits for AP again instead of latching the gate open until reboot.

## [2.5.0-beta.12] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- AP Injection Gate Summon detection no longer latches `Summoning` permanently after the first summon use. `UI_summonHeartbeat` is no longer used for activity tracking because it keeps cycling 0..3 indefinitely once summon has run, which prevented the gate from ever closing again. Detection now relies solely on `UI_selfParkRequest` (CAN 1016, byte 3 bits 4-7); the flag holds for 5 s after the last non-zero command and is also force-cleared whenever the vehicle returns to Park, so a manual P->D shift after a completed summon correctly waits for AP again.

## [2.5.0-beta.11] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- AP Injection Gate now also stays open while Summon / Smart Park is active. HW3 and HW4 handlers parse `UI_driverAssistControl` (CAN ID 1016) `UI_summonHeartbeat` (byte 0 bits 2-3) and `UI_selfParkRequest` (byte 3 bits 4-7); when either is non-zero, `Summoning` is asserted and held for 1500 ms after the last activity, so injection keeps running once the vehicle shifts out of Park into Drive/Reverse under Summon control.

## [2.5.0-beta.10] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- AP Injection Gate park detection now also reads `DI_systemStatus` (CAN ID 280) `DI_gear`, so the "Start after AP" gate reopens when the vehicle is shifted to Park on Chassis-bus connections that do not carry `DIF_torque`/`DIR_torque` (CAN ID 390). MCP2515 hardware filter slots updated for Legacy, HW3, and HW4 modes to admit ID 280.

## [2.5.0-beta.9] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- Dashboard speed profiles now include an `Auto` mode. Auto follows the vehicle follow-distance selection, while a manual dashboard profile stays locked and is injected instead of being overwritten by the car.

### Fixed

- Dashboard manual profile selection now persists in firmware state and is applied to Legacy, HW3, and HW4 injection paths.

## [2.5.0-beta.8] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- AP Injection Gate now also opens while the vehicle is in Park, so Summon unlock injection can run while parked and stops again after shifting to Drive.

## [2.5.0-beta.7] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- OTA update finalize now passes `true` to `Update.end()` to force completion regardless of residual byte count, fixing the `Update finalize failed` error that could occur after a successful download via GitHub S3 redirects.
- OTA error paths now log `Update.errorString()` at every failure point (begin, write, finalize) so the root cause is visible in the dashboard log instead of a generic message.

## [2.5.0-beta.6] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- AP Injection Gate now waits for DAS `AutopilotStatus` active states instead of the 1021 UI/config bit, preventing plugin injection from switching to Active when AP is not engaged.

## [2.5.0-beta.5] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- AP Injection Gate now detects active AP from recorded HW3 `1021` mux `0` frames by reading the observed AD bit, so plugin injection no longer stays stuck at `Waiting AP` after Autopilot is engaged.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-04-24

First stable release of the 2.5 series. Bundles all changes from 2.5.0-beta.1 through 2.5.0-beta.4.

### Added

- Dashboard configuration now includes a GTW 2047 plugin replay control, and settings backup/import now preserves plugin replay preferences.
- Dashboard configuration now includes an AP Injection Gate toggle that arms plugin injection but waits until AP/NoA is observed active before sending plugin frames.
- Plugin rules now support `counter` fields and `emit_periodic` for cached GTW mux 3 broadcasts, including editor support and updated plugin documentation.
- Plugin rules now support a `bus` field (`CH`, `VEH`, `PARTY`, comma-separated string, bitmask, or array) to restrict matching to specific CAN bus pins; frames with unknown bus still match for backwards compatibility.
- Plugin rules now support a `mux_mask` field (alias `muxMask`) to control which bits of byte 0 are compared for mux matching; values 0-7 default to low-3-bit mask, values 8-255 default to full-byte mask, enabling low-nibble and full-byte DBC mux styles.
- Plugin list API now includes `bus` and `mux_mask` per rule so the dashboard UI and support exports reflect full rule configuration.
- Plugin editor gained bus and mux-mask input fields per rule, and the rule label, summary, and conflict panel now show bus pin and mux/mask.
- GTW periodic emit can now optionally try to silence native gateway broadcasts through a UDS diagnostic sequence using extended session, SecurityAccess, `CommunicationControl`, and `TesterPresent`.
- HW3 dashboard builds now expose an optional offset slew limiter for plugin-driven mux 2 offset changes.
- Added the shared `INJECTION_AFTER_AP` build option for behaviour-option builds; `ENHANCED_AUTOPILOT` mux 1 injection now waits for AP to be active when this option is enabled.
- Added a WiFi dashboard regression test that covers the WiFi settings UI, backend routes, status payload, and backup fields.
- Added native PlatformIO test environments `native_plugin_engine` and `native_plugin_engine_custom_key` for running plugin engine unit tests without hardware.

### Changed

- Plugin rules now allow up to 16 operations per rule instead of 8.
- `PLUGIN_FILTER_IDS_MAX` raised to 32 (was equal to `PLUGIN_RULES_MAX` = 16) and made overridable at build time.
- Replayed GTW frames, periodic emits, and repeated Rule Test sends now advance counter fields and refresh checksums between sends.
- Dashboard plugin details, validation, support exports, and docs now describe the new replay, counter, and periodic emit behavior.
- `gtw_silent: true` is now silently treated as disabled at parse time unless `PLUGIN_GTW_UDS_CUSTOM_KEY` is defined at build time; the periodic emit still works but no UDS sequence is started and `0x684`/`0x685` filter IDs are not injected.
- UDS request frames sent by the GTW silencing state machine are now tagged with the bus of the frame that seeded the periodic emit cache.
- Incoming frames with `CAN_BUS_ANY` are now normalized to `CAN_BUS_DEFAULT` in the main app loop before being passed to the plugin engine.
- Plugin rule mux matching and test-rule matching refactored into shared `pluginRuleMatchesBus` / `pluginRuleMatchesMux` helpers used by both the engine and the dashboard.
- Plugin editor mux input range extended to -1-255 (was -1-7) to support full-byte DBC mux values.

### Fixed

- GTW silent-mode plugin rules now add the required UDS request/response CAN IDs to the active filter set so the diagnostic state machine can observe replies.
- The CAN analyzer now labels UDS `0x28 CommunicationControl` requests by name.
- WiFi Internet status now follows the live STA connection state reliably after connect attempts and page refreshes instead of getting stuck on `Connecting to ...` or `Not configured`.
- Corrupted WiFi SSID fragments are now ignored in saved settings and filtered from `/wifi_status` responses.
- The WiFi settings form no longer overwrites the SSID field while it is being edited, and the status header no longer depends on optional labels being present.
- Dashboard CAN sniffer and recorder buffers now clamp incoming frame DLC before copying frame data.
- Plugin mux matching now ignores zero-DLC frames instead of treating them as mux 0.
- Plugin conflict detection and detail panel now correctly account for bus mask and mux mask when determining whether two rules can affect the same frame.
- Custom-key plugin engine native tests now validate output against the configured `PLUGIN_GTW_UDS_KEY_READY` value instead of a hard-coded key byte.

## [2.5.0-beta.4] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- Dashboard configuration now includes an AP Injection Gate toggle that arms plugin injection but waits until AP/NoA is observed active before sending plugin frames.
- Added the shared `INJECTION_AFTER_AP` build option for behaviour-option builds; `ENHANCED_AUTOPILOT` mux 1 injection now waits for AP to be active when this option is enabled.

### Fixed

- Custom-key plugin engine native tests now validate output against the configured `PLUGIN_GTW_UDS_KEY_READY` value instead of a hard-coded key byte.

## [2.5.0-beta.3] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- Plugin rules now support a `bus` field (`CH`, `VEH`, `PARTY`, comma-separated string, bitmask, or array) to restrict matching to specific CAN bus pins; frames with unknown bus still match for backwards compatibility.
- Plugin rules now support a `mux_mask` field (alias `muxMask`) to control which bits of byte 0 are compared for mux matching; values 0–7 default to low-3-bit mask, values 8–255 default to full-byte mask, enabling low-nibble and full-byte DBC mux styles.
- Plugin list API now includes `bus` and `mux_mask` per rule so the dashboard UI and support exports reflect full rule configuration.
- Plugin editor gained bus and mux-mask input fields per rule, and the rule label, summary, and conflict panel now show bus pin and mux/mask.

## [2.4.2-beta.1] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- Legacy speed profile selection is now written back into outgoing CAN ID `1006` mux `0` frames so the selected profile actually takes effect on vehicle behavior instead of only changing the observed internal state.
- Added a native Legacy regression test that verifies the selected speed profile bits are injected into the transmitted mux `0` frame.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Dashboard header now shows the latest observed `GTW_autopilot` state next to the selected hardware mode.
- Native dashboard regression tests now assert that dashboard handlers do not send frames, increment `framesSent`, or fire `onSend`.
- README and dashboard footer now include the support and gift information from `main`.

### Changed
- Dashboard builds no longer compile automatic CAN injection paths from Legacy, HW3, or HW4 handlers; enabled plugins are the automatic injection path.
- HW3 no longer listens for or injects Track Mode request frames.
- ESP32 dashboard builds now use a 4MB OTA partition layout with larger app slots while preserving SPIFFS storage.
- Plugin documentation now describes the dashboard's plugin-only automatic injection behavior instead of firmware overlap warnings.
- Rule Test count and interval controls now use visible labels with `1` and `100` as placeholders, while empty fields still default to one injection every 100 ms.
- Support issue flow now copies the dashboard support report to the clipboard and opens the General Issue form without prefilled title or body text.

### Fixed
- ESP32 dashboard hotspot startup is more reliable by starting the AP earlier, disabling WiFi sleep, validating saved AP/STA credentials, and falling back to AP-only mode when STA connection attempts time out.

## [2.4.1-beta.3] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- ESP32 dashboard hotspot startup is more reliable by starting the AP earlier, disabling WiFi sleep, validating saved AP/STA credentials, and falling back to AP-only mode when STA connection attempts time out.

## [2.4.1-beta.2] - 2026-04-20

### Changed
- Rule Test count and interval controls now use visible labels with `1` and `100` as placeholders, while empty fields still default to one injection every 100 ms.
- Support issue flow now copies the dashboard support report to the clipboard and opens the General Issue form without prefilled title or body text.

## [2.4.1-beta.1] - 2026-04-20

### Added

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-19

## [2.4.0-beta.1] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- Dashboard plugin priority controls now let users choose which enabled plugin wins overlapping bit writes
- Dashboard plugin conflict warnings now show firmware overlaps, plugin priority overlaps, and the first enabled injection priority

### Changed
- Plugin installs now start disabled so users can review priority and conflicts before enabling them
- Rule Test now waits for the next matching live CAN frame, applies the selected rule to that frame, and injects the captured result with the chosen count and interval
- Dashboard polling now keeps `/status` as the connection gate and backs off non-critical polls during reconnects

### Fixed
- Plugin rules targeting the same CAN ID and mux are merged into one injected frame per incoming frame, preventing contradictory duplicate plugin sends in the same cycle
- TWAI dashboard filtering now drops sparse-mask false positives in software, reducing dashboard load when plugin CAN IDs widen the hardware mask
- Dashboard status rendering no longer breaks when optional status-grid elements are removed or rearranged
- Dashboard remains responsive under heavier CAN/plugin load by limiting per-loop frame draining and giving the web task more scheduling priority

## [2.3.2-beta.2] - 2026-04-18

### Changed
- Dashboard no longer exposes or persists speed profile control; follow distance and the derived profile remain visible as read-only status
- Dashboard profile-related boot logging and legacy NVS cleanup now reflect the new plugin-managed model without stale `SP` or profile-lock state

### Fixed
- Dashboard core no longer injects speed profile or speed offset back onto CAN for Legacy, HW3, or HW4 handlers; those values are now observational unless a plugin explicitly modifies those frames
- Dashboard plugin toggles now apply immediately and batch their persistence, avoiding repeated Wi-Fi stalls while enabling or disabling multiple plugins

## [2.3.2-beta.1] - 2026-04-18

### Changed
- Dashboard builds now ignore all `BEHAVIOUR OPTIONS` from `platformio_profile.h`; these overrides are plugin-managed and are no longer compiled into firmware when `ESP32_DASHBOARD` is enabled

### Fixed
- Dashboard injection stop now also blocks plugin-based frame injection instead of letting enabled plugins keep sending
- TWAI dashboard profile syncing no longer forces commented-out behavior options into the build
- Dashboard boot/runtime state no longer reports legacy built-in ISA, emergency vehicle detection, TLSSC bypass, or nag handling as active in plugin-managed builds
- Plugin cards no longer show the obsolete built-in conflict warning badge and message

## [2.3.1] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- Dashboard hardware defaults now follow `platformio_profile.h` reliably for dashboard builds, even when older `DASH_DEFAULT_HW` values still exist in the selected PlatformIO environment
- Reflashing a dashboard build with a new default hardware mode now migrates stale stored hardware defaults from NVS without overwriting an explicit hardware choice made later in the web UI

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- Dedicated documentation pages for build and flash setup, dashboard usage, and a docs index for GitHub Pages
- Hardware-specific example plugins for HW3 and HW4 feature replacements, including AD activation, TLSSC bypass, nag suppression, Summon unlock, ISA chime suppression, emergency vehicle detection, and HW4 speed offsets

### Changed
- Dashboard Features card now only exposes Enable Logging; the other vehicle overrides are no longer shown there
- GitHub Actions are now split into separate workflows for tests, releases, and GitHub Pages deployment
- Dashboard and README documentation now reflect the plugin-based override flow and current Pages structure

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-18

First stable release of the 2.2 series. Bundles all changes from 2.2.0-beta.1 through 2.2.0-beta.14.

### Added
- Plugin Editor UI with live JSON preview, duplicate-name detection, download/export, install support, loading of installed plugins, and a rule test tool for sending generated CAN frames
- CAN Sniffer support for switching between on-wire 11-bit IDs and prefixed DBC JSON IDs, with filtering for both formats
- Dashboard improvements including plugin capacity visibility, default CAN pin hints, a hidden SSID option for the WiFi hotspot, and an Atom S3 Mini injection toggle on the built-in button

### Changed
- Dashboard defaults now follow the selected build flags, including injection-on-boot behavior and vehicle-aware web UI defaults for TWAI and MCP2515 targets
- `esp32_feather_v2_mcp2515` now uses the new MCP2515 driver and web UI
- Reinstalling an existing plugin now preserves its enabled state and works cleanly when the plugin list is already full

### Fixed
- Plugin enable/disable and remove state is now persisted correctly across reboot, and install/remove/toggle actions refresh the dashboard immediately without falling back to a misleading connection error
- Dashboard polling, confirmation flows, and plugin detail panels now behave reliably across reconnects and Chrome on iOS
- WiFi STA/AP persistence, optional NVS reads, injection persistence, and runtime AD gating now behave consistently across reboots and firmware updates
- Atom and Atom S3 builds now use the correct RGB LED pins and a release-safe ESP32 LED API path across the supported CI toolchains

## [2.2.0-beta.14] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- Plugin install, remove and enable/disable actions in the dashboard now refresh the plugin list immediately instead of waiting for a manual page refresh
- Dashboard plugin installs no longer fall back to a misleading "Connection error" when the plugin was already applied and only the response body was interrupted
- Atom and Atom S3 dashboard builds now use an ESP32 RGB LED API path that stays compatible across the release CI toolchains

## [2.2.0-beta.13] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- Atom S3 Mini builds can now toggle injection with the built-in button on GPIO41, with the state saved so it persists across reboot

### Fixed
- Atom and Atom S3 dashboard builds now drive the built-in RGB status LED from the correct board pins so injection-off shows red and injection-on shows green reliably

## [2.2.0-beta.12] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- Plugin detail panels in the dashboard now stay open across the background plugin-list refresh instead of collapsing unexpectedly
- Dashboard confirmation prompts now use an in-page modal so reboot and other confirm actions work reliably in Chrome on iOS

## [2.2.0-beta.11] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- Plugin Editor can now load installed plugins for in-place editing
- Plugin Editor now includes a rule test tool that can send a generated CAN frame multiple times at a chosen interval

### Changed
- Reinstalling an existing plugin by name now preserves its enabled/disabled state and still works when the plugin list is already full

### Fixed
- Atom S3 and Atom Lite dashboard builds can now save CAN pin settings that use GPIO 6-11 instead of being blocked by the generic ESP32 flash-pin restriction

## [2.2.0-beta.10] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- Plugin enabled/disabled state is now persisted across reboot instead of defaulting back to enabled on startup
- Removing a plugin now also clears its persisted enabled/disabled state
- Dashboard background polling now stops cleanly after repeated connection failures and points users to the STA IP after WiFi handoff instead of continuously spamming timeout errors

## [2.2.0-beta.9] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- CAN Sniffer now has a toggle to switch between on-wire 11-bit CAN IDs and DBC JSON IDs with the current bus prefix
- The sniffer filter now accepts both on-wire IDs and prefixed DBC JSON IDs

### Changed
- Migrated `esp32_feather_v2_mcp2515` to the new MCP2515 driver and web UI
- Dashboard feature and injection defaults now follow the selected build flags, and `DASH_INJECTION_ON_BOOT` can be used to start injecting automatically after boot
- Dashboard grid inputs now size correctly in narrower layouts, and `platformio_profile.h` no longer ships with `DRIVER_TWAI` and `HW3` preselected by default

### Fixed
- "Stop Injecting" now persists across reboot instead of silently re-enabling injection on startup
- Runtime AD gating is now applied consistently across Legacy, HW3, and HW4 handlers so blocked mux paths no longer keep injecting

## [2.2.0-beta.8] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- Plugins card now shows the maximum plugin capacity, current usage, and a clearer message when the plugin limit has been reached
- `/plugins` now returns `maxPlugins`, and plugin install errors include the configured maximum

### Fixed
- `DRIVER_TWAI` dashboard builds now treat the vehicle selection in `platformio_profile.h` as the default web UI hardware only; if none is selected, `HW3` is used by default
- WiFi STA credentials are now loaded correctly from NVS on boot after being saved through the dashboard
- Optional AP and WiFi preference reads no longer spam `Preferences` `NOT_FOUND` errors when keys have not been stored yet
- Added the option to show default can pins in webdashboard

## [2.2.0-beta.7] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- Hidden SSID option in the WiFi Hotspot card. When enabled, the access point does not broadcast its SSID — clients have to enter the name manually. Setting is persisted in NVS and included in the settings backup/restore JSON (`ap.hidden`)
- `/ap_config` endpoint accepts a new `hidden` parameter; `/ap_status` returns the current `hidden` flag

## [2.2.0-beta.6] - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- Dashboard layout: the two separate Firmware Update cards (GitHub OTA and manual .bin upload) have been merged into a single card. Manual .bin upload is now a collapsible section under the primary update controls
- WiFi Internet moved into its own top-level card (previously nested inside the Plugins card) — it is used for both firmware updates and plugin downloads, so it deserves its own slot

## [2.2.0-beta.5] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- Firmware Update check: no longer offers older versions as "updates". A proper semantic-version comparison is now used (major.minor.patch plus alpha/beta/rc pre-release ranking), so a device on `2.2.0-beta.4` will not be prompted to "update" to `2.0.0` or `2.1.0`
- Auto-Update on Boot uses the same comparison (older releases are skipped)
- CI release job: firmware binaries are now reliably attached to GitHub releases. The workflow first creates the release as a draft, uploads all assets, and then publishes it, which works around the repository's "immutable releases" setting that previously blocked asset uploads after publish

## [2.2.0-beta.4] - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- Default dashboard credentials (`changeme`) are now allowed at build time. Users are expected to change the WiFi AP password and OTA credentials at runtime via the dashboard WiFi Hotspot card (persisted in NVS, OTA-safe)
- Build no longer fails when `DASH_PASS` / `DASH_OTA_PASS` are left at the default `changeme` placeholder

### Removed
- Nag Killer toggle removed from the dashboard Features card. The underlying `NAG_KILLER` build flag remains available for advanced users who want to compile it in

## [2.2.0-beta.3] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- Firmware Update check: "JSON parse error" when Beta Channel is enabled (reduced GitHub API response size by using `per_page=1` instead of `per_page=5`, avoids ArduinoJson heap overflow on ESP32)
- CI: firmware artifacts are now correctly attached to GitHub releases. Previous releases failed to attach binaries due to an "immutable release" error when the release was published before the upload step ran

### Changed
- CI release notes: workflow now extracts the matching section from `CHANGELOG.md` for each tag instead of using the whole file, and auto-detects prerelease based on the tag name (`beta`/`alpha`/`rc`)

## [2.2.0-beta.2] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- Auto-Update on Boot: optional toggle in the Firmware Update card. When enabled, the device checks GitHub for a newer release ~15 seconds after the WiFi Internet connection comes up and installs it automatically
- Respects the Beta Channel toggle (only installs prereleases when that is on)
- Setting persisted in NVS so it survives firmware updates
- New endpoints: `/auto_update` (GET/POST)

## [2.2.0-beta.1] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- Plugin Editor card: create plugins via a form UI without writing JSON manually
- Support for all plugin ops: set_bit, set_byte, or_byte, and_byte, checksum
- Per-rule configuration of CAN ID, optional mux value, and send flag
- Live JSON preview updating as you edit, with collapsible rule sections
- Client-side validation (ID, mux, bit 0-63, byte 0-7, value 0-255, hex input `0xFF` supported)
- One-click Install via existing `/plugin_upload` endpoint (no backend changes)
- Download generated plugin as a standalone `.json` file for sharing or backup
- Duplicate-name detection against existing installed plugins

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-15

First stable release of the 2.1 series. Bundles all changes from 2.1.0-beta.1 through 2.1.0-beta.5.

### Added
- **Rebrand & UX:** renamed UI from "ADUnlock" to "ev-open-can-tools"; dynamic footer with firmware version and device IP; GitHub and Discord links in the footer
- **Plugins:** info icon next to "Plugins" with inline explanation and link to plugin documentation with examples
- **CAN Pins:** runtime-configurable CAN TX/RX GPIO pins via the dashboard, persisted in NVS so custom pin configurations survive OTA firmware updates; validation (GPIO 0-39, TX != RX, GPIO 6-11 blocked for SPI flash)
- **WiFi Internet:** network scanner with RSSI and channel info; static IP configuration (IP, gateway, subnet, DNS); dedicated status and scan endpoints
- **WiFi Hotspot:** change AP name and password via the dashboard; credentials stored in NVS and survive firmware updates
- **OTA firmware updates from GitHub releases:** check for updates and install directly from the dashboard, with beta channel toggle
- **Status badges** ("saved" / "firmware default") on WiFi Hotspot and WiFi Internet cards, plus an info icon explaining NVS persistence
- **Settings Backup / Restore:** export all persistent settings (AP, WiFi Internet, CAN pins, beta flag) as JSON and restore in one go — disaster recovery for full-erase or cross-device migration

### Note
- WiFi credentials have been OTA-safe since the original 2.1 series; the badges and backup feature make that explicit and add recovery paths for full-flash-erase scenarios.

## [2.1.0-beta.5] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- Visible "saved" / "firmware default" status badge on the WiFi Hotspot and WiFi Internet cards
- Info icon on WiFi Hotspot card explaining that credentials are stored in NVS and survive firmware updates
- Settings Backup card: export all persistent settings (AP, WiFi Internet, CAN pins, beta flag) as JSON for safekeeping or migration to another device
- Settings Restore: upload a previously exported JSON to restore all persistent settings in one go
- New endpoints: /settings_export (GET), /settings_import (POST)

### Note
- WiFi credentials were already OTA-safe in prior versions; these changes make the persistence explicit in the UI and add disaster-recovery via backup file

## [2.1.0-beta.4] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- Runtime-configurable CAN TX/RX pins: configure GPIO pins for the TWAI transceiver directly from the dashboard
- Pin configuration is persisted in NVS so it survives OTA firmware updates
- New "CAN Pins" dashboard card with validation (GPIO 0-39, TX != RX, GPIO 6-11 blocked for SPI flash) and reboot flow
- New endpoints: /can_pins (GET/POST)

### Fixed
- OTA updates no longer risk breaking CAN communication on boards with custom pin configurations — once pins are configured via the dashboard they persist across updates

## [2.1.0-beta.3] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- Plugin info icon: click the (i) next to "Plugins" to see an inline explanation of what plugins are and how they work, with a link to the documentation and examples
- Footer community links: GitHub repository and Discord invite are now linked in the dashboard footer

## [2.1.0-beta.2] - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- Rebrand: renamed all UI references from "ADUnlock" to "ev-open-can-tools"
- Footer now shows current firmware version and dynamically adapts to the device IP
- Removed hardcoded hardware references from footer

### Added
- WiFi network scanner: scan and display available networks in the dashboard, select by clicking
- Signal strength indicators (RSSI) and channel info for each scanned network
- Static IP configuration: optionally set IP, gateway, subnet mask and DNS server
- OTA firmware update from GitHub releases: check for updates and install directly from the dashboard
- Beta channel toggle: switch between stable and pre-release firmware versions
- Firmware version auto-injected from VERSION file at build time
- Dedicated WiFi status endpoint (/wifi_status) and scan endpoint (/wifi_scan)
- WiFi hotspot configuration: change AP name and password via the dashboard
- New update endpoints: /update_check, /update_install, /update_beta
- New AP endpoints: /ap_config, /ap_status

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Plugin system: install CAN frame modification rules as JSON files via web dashboard
- Plugin Manager UI card with install from URL, file upload, enable/disable and remove
- Paste JSON (offline): install plugins by pasting JSON directly into the dashboard — no internet or file picker needed
- Plugin detail view: expandable rule inspector showing CAN IDs, mux values and all operations per plugin
- Conflict detection: warns with a visual indicator when plugin CAN IDs overlap with base firmware handlers
- WiFi STA mode (AP+STA) for internet access to download plugins
- Plugin engine with mux-aware matching and operations: set_bit, set_byte, or_byte, and_byte, checksum
- Automatic CAN filter merging for plugin-required IDs
- ArduinoJson v7 dependency for all ESP32 dashboard environments
- New API endpoints: /plugins, /plugin_upload, /plugin_install, /plugin_toggle, /plugin_remove, /wifi_config
- Plugin documentation with format reference, examples and CAN ID table (docs/plugins.md)

### Fixed
- Credential placeholder check in build script now matches platformio_profile.h defaults
- CI release job: firmware artifacts renamed to unique filenames to prevent upload conflicts

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-10
